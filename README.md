# Restaurant Analysis


I need to use fuzzwuzz a lot earlier before running anything else

I need to try to use google places to match more Places

I need to find a lot more correlations/play with interrelationships

- Making sure its the right business associated to the right name and trying to fix




## Part 2: Visualize More


- How do the yelp data correlate with the score directly?

- How do they correlate between each others?




## Part 3: Regress


- What are the best methods?

- What does it tell me?

- What are the limitations of my model?



## Part 4: Using Reviews?
